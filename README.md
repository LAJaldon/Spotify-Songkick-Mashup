# Spotify-Songkick-Mashup

This application uses the Spotify API to allow the user to search for artists, recommended artists, and to see the songs and albums of each artist. 
Also, the Songkick API is used to find out about the upcoming concerts of an artist. A pdf is attached to this repository that shows how the application uses
these APIs to achieve the functionalities that have been mentioned.
